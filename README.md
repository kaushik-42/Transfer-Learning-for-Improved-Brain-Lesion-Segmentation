## Abstract:

In this project, we aim to extend the existing model ”Efficient Multi-Scale 3D CNN with Fully Connected
CRF for Accurate Brain Lesion Segmentation” by applying transfer learning techniques. The original model,
developed by Kamnitsas et al., is a dual pathway, 11-layer deep, three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network
(3D CNN) that has shown promising results in the task of brain lesion segmentation.

We plan to experiment with various pre-trained models such as U-Net and DeepLabV3. These models
have been successful in various image segmentation tasks, and we believe they could provide valuable features
for our task. The datasets we will be using for this project include ISLES 2015 and BRATS 2015. These
datasets contain multi-modal MRI scans with annotated brain lesions, which serve as a ground truth for training
and evaluating our models.

The original model achieved a Dice Score of 85.0% on the BRATS-2015 dataset, ranking 2nd globally
for the task of Brain Tumor Segmentation. For the task of Lesion Segmentation on the ISLES-2015 dataset,
it achieved a Dice Score of 59.0%, ranking 1st globally. By applying transfer learning techniques to this
already successful model, we hope to further improve these scores and provide an even more accurate tool for
brain lesion segmentation. We believe our work could contribute to more accurate and efficient diagnostic tools
in healthcare.
